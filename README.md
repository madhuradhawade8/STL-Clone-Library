# STL-Clone-Library
Overview

The STL Clone Library is an implementation of selected components from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of how STL containers, algorithms, and utilities work under the hood. The primary goal is to replicate the behavior of STL while adhering to best practices like memory management, exception safety, and performance optimization.

Features

Custom implementation of common STL containers:
Vector
List
Stack
Queue
Map
Set

Iterators support
Algorithms like sort, find, accumulate
Memory management using smart pointers
Exception safety
Unit tests for all components

Motivation
This project serves as a learning exercise to:
Understand the internal workings of STL containers.
Improve knowledge of template programming.
Gain hands-on experience in writing reusable, generic code.
Strengthen C++ concepts like RAII, iterators, and algorithms.
